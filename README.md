### Running the project locally: 
Clone or download the file. Make sure you're using the correct version of Ruby (2.5.1). Install RVM to manage the version or Ruby you're using. [RVM link](https://rvm.io/). First, run 'bundle install' to install all necessary gems. Run 'rails db:migrate' to migrate tables into your database. Once you migrate tables, run 'rails s' or 'rails server' and this will point you to localhost://3000 in the browser. You can now click the link or type that into your browser and view/play with the project.

_You can run the rails console by typing 'rails console' in case you need to add or remove from tables manually._

### Validations

Application is built for shippers to help them organize all of the ships in their fleet, with a user login system using Devise. We built this to further our MVC trinity knowledge and better understand ActiveRecord associations. The application allows users to:

Sign up, login and logout

Create new ships that will associate with the userâ€™s profile. Ships have the following attributes:

Name
Amount of containers its able to ship
Location (stored as a string)
